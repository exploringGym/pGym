# Programming Gymn

After a few years of working in a corporation, I see how rusty I am. It feels
frustrating.

# The pGymn project

This project is created as a mental exercise gym.

It is not meant to take much of my free time but rather keep a routine of
practicing that goes together with other studies and work.

At first I don't plan on having the best possible solution for the exercises.

That should be a natural improvement.

The idea is to practice and work on my basic skills again and have a routine.
